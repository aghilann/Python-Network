# Python - Networking
 I was bored and wanted to learn a little bit of how Internet Networks work so I watched [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGdiSJakIS4) video and followed along with the excercises so I can get a better understanding
 of how some basic networking topics work in a interactive way. I followed along with the code and I can explain these topics conceptually but I am nowhere I have
 nowhere near the level of knowledge required to explain why the code itself works. I could explain only the bare basics and the goal of the script and how it works,
 but not line by line.
